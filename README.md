The system allows **admins** to manage car rentals, generate reports, and track bookings, while **customers** can book cars, view booking history, and update their profiles. The project was developed as part of a university assignment to apply OOP principles in real-world software development.

## Features

### Admin Functionalities
- **Login System**: Secure login for admin accounts.
- **Car Management**: Add, edit, delete, and view car records.
- **Booking Management**: Confirm payments and manage customer bookings.
- **Report Generation**: Generate daily reports and monthly income analyses (e.g., through a ring chart).

### Customer Functionalities
- **Login and Registration**: Customers can register or log in to access services.
- **Car Booking**: Book cars by selecting rental periods.
- **Booking History**: View past bookings and payment receipts.
- **Profile Management**: Update personal details such as email and address.

## Technical Highlights
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **GUI Framework**: Swing (for graphical user interfaces)
- **Data Management**: Local storage (to simulate database functionality)
- **OOP Principles**: All functionalities are implemented with modular and reusable classes adhering to OOP best practices.

## AI-Related Future Enhancements
While the current system focuses on OOP, its design can be extended with AI features, such as:
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Use machine learning to predict when cars require maintenance based on usage patterns.
- **Customer Preferences**: AI algorithms to recommend cars based on previous bookings and preferences.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Implement pricing models that adapt to demand and availability using AI optimization techniques.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze customer feedback to enhance the booking experience and car inventory.
